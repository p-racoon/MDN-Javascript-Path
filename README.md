# MDN-Javascript-Path [WIP]
I always get distracted with so many links and references that MDN or any well documented pages have in general, that I loose track of where I was and where should I be going next. Hence I am creating this Learning path to keep a track and follow a straight line.
This one is for this Guide [JavaScript — Dynamic client-side scripting by MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

## JS learning Path

1. [JavaScript first steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps) 
In our first JavaScript module, we first answer some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", before moving on to taking you through your first practical experience of writing JavaScript. After that, we discuss some key building blocks in detail, such as variables, strings, numbers and arrays.

2. [JavaScript building blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks)
In this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code block such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events. You've seen this stuff already in the course, but only in passing — here we'll discuss it all explicitly.
